//        years from the user

//        Future Value (FV)

//        Total Interest Earned = FV - P

        // FORMULAS
        FV = P * (1 + Math.pow((r / 365), (365 * t)));
        total_Interest_Earned = FV - P;
//        b. It would display the future value and the total interest earned
        // OUTPUTS

        System.out.printf("The total interest you would have earned is: $%.2f \n", total_Interest_Earned);


//    Example: If you deposit $1,000 in a CD that earns 1.75%
//        interest and matures in 5 years, your CD's ending balance will
//        be $1,092.62 and you would have earned $92.62 in interest
//    Note: The numbers above assume daily compounding
